Feature: Dashboards

#  As a general user I want to have dashboards displayed on the homepage.
  Scenario: Validate all the dashboard names
    Given I navigate to Interview Prep
    Then I should see the login page
    Then I enter "test@yahoo.com" in the Email input box
    And I enter "testuser123" in the Password input box
    And I click "Login" button
    Then I validate the following icons on the dashboard
    | All topics   |
    | Coding       |
    | Soft skills  |
    | Cucumber     |
    | Java         |
    | Selenium     |
    | Jmeter       |














#when the user clicks on each dashboard icon, the user should be directed to the dashboard page
